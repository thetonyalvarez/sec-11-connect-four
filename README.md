# Features to Implement
### "Health" bar for each player
Player health bar that goes down as each player makes a move.
Consecutive pieces from your opponent will cause your health to drop more dramatically.

### SVG animation of avatars on move 
When a player makes a move, animate its avatar to mimic a button push like you would see in Street Fighter.

### Add a "RESET GAME" button
